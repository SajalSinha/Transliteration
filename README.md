The web-app is built on googleapi. I was able to train model and save it, but could not load and develop UI as I don't have much knowledge regarding this. Apologies. 

Training on NEWS2018 dataset with 1000 samples can be found in this drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/146CA2gghCSj-plE8lN9zf4hkpIpjYPI8?usp=sharing
